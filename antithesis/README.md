# jepsen.antithesis

This library supports running Jepsen tests inside Antithesis environments. It
provides entropy, lifecycle hooks, and assertions.

## Randomness

You should wrap your entire program in `(with-rng ...)`. This does nothing in
ordinary environments, but in Antithesis, it replaces the jepsen.random RNG
with one powered by Antithesis.

## Lifecycle

Call `setup-complete!` once the test is ready to begin. Call `event!` to
signal interesting things have happened.

## Assertions

Assertions begin with `assert-`, and take an expression, a message, and data
to include if the assertion fails. For instance:

(assert-always! (not (db-corrupted?)) \"DB corrupted\" {:db \"foo\"})"
