# jepsen.generator

This library provides the compositional generator system at the heart of
[Jepsen](https://jepsen.io). Generators produce a series of operations Jepsen
would like to perform against a system, like "Set key `x` to 3". They also
react to operations as they happen. For example, if the write fails, the
generator could decide to retry it.

In addition to the generators themselves, this library provides:

- `jepsen.random`: Pluggable random values
- `jepsen.generator.test`: Helpers for testing generators
- `jepsen.generator.context`: A high-performance, pure data structure which
  keeps track of the state used by generators
- `jepsen.generator.translation-table`: Maps worker threads to integers
